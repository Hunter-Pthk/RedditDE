Several months earlier, my small team thought that we need orchestrator like Prefect, cloud like Neon, and dbt. But now I think developing and deploying data pipeline inside Snowflake alone is more than enough to move sales and marketing data into it. Some data task can also be scheduled using Task Scheduler in Windows, then into Snowflake. If we need a more advanced approach, snowpark could be built.

We surely need connector like Fivetran to help us with the social media data. However, the urge to build data infrastructure using multiple tools is much lower now.

1i5s6pt,Databricks or MS Fabric,"Hello,
I currently work at a company where we have a data warehouse (DWH) hosted on an on-premises SQL Server database. Every day, we execute a series of pipelines from Azure Data Factory, which are responsible for extracting information from the sources (OLTP databases and some CSV files in Azure Blob Storage) and loading it into staging tables in the DWH. Afterward, we use stored procedures to create dimensions (DIMs) and facts.

The issue is that the volume of data has grown significantly, and nightly loads are taking much longer to complete. I believe this is happening because we are using an OLTP database rather than an analytical database.

The decision to build this DWH on SQL Server was made many years ago, before I joined the company.

Now we are considering migrating the entire DWH infrastructure to something more modern. I have been researching, and I like the Databricks medallion lakehouse architecture using a Spark cluster. However, I’ve also seen that many people are beginning to adopt this architecture using MS Fabric with a SQL dedicated pool, which could also be implemented here.

Which option would you recommend for this migration to achieve the best possible performance and cost? Also, what about development time?

P.S.: Our DWH currently weighs 8TB.",11,19,Used_Shelter_3213,2025-01-20 15:06:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1i5s6pt/databricks_or_ms_fabric/,False,False,False,False

1i5xwm2,Make Iceberg table data available to other systems,"I have an AWS Glue catalog with multiple Iceberg tables stored in S3. I want to make the data of these iceberg tables available to other applications inside the company which will consume the data. 

The data volume is low, so solutions like redshift are too expensive for us. Currently our main query engine is AWS Athena, but it has a bunch of limitations like the number of queries it can start within some interval of time. 

Also, I don't want to mantain an ETL pipeline to replicate the data from the iceberg table to a relational database. I want to consume the data directly from S3.

My main attempt was to use duckdb inside a postgresql container, but duckdb iceberg support is still in development.

1i5w2lk,Recommendations for a Low-Code Data Transformation Tool Similar to Power Query?,"Hey All,

I’m looking for a low-code solution for performing data transformations—something that works like Power Query in Power BI, where you press buttons and use an intuitive interface to clean and transform data without manually writing code for each step.

Ideally, I’m hoping for:
	•	A tool or plugin that integrates with Python (or works standalone).
	•	A low-code or no-code approach for data cleaning and transformation.
	•	Compatibility with PyCharm or VS Code as a plugin would be a bonus.
	•	Free or paid options—I’m open to either, as long as it’s efficient and user-friendly.

Does anyone know of any tools or plugins that fit the bill? Any recommendations or insights would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks in advance!",4,3,Wonderful-Ad6140,2025-01-20 17:46:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1i5w2lk/recommendations_for_a_lowcode_data_transformation/,False,False,False,False
