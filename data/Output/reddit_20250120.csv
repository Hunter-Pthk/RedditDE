1i50mw6,Pinterest Data Tech Stack,"Sharing my 7th tech stack series article.

Pinterest is a great tech savy company with dozens of tech used across teams. I thought this would be great for the readers.

Content is based on multiple sources including Tech Blog, Open Source websites, news articles. You will find references as you read.

Couple of points:
- The tech discussed is from multiple teams.
- Certain aspects are not covered due to not enough information available publicly. E.g. how each system work with each other.
- Pinterest leverages multiple tech for exabyte scala data lake.
- Recently migrated from Druid to StarRocks.
- StarRocks and Snowflake primary purpose is storage in this case, hence mentioned under storage.
- Pinterest maintains their own flavor of Flink and Airflow.
- Headsup! The article contains a sponsor.


Let me know what I missed.

1i4xbdk,How to handle open ended design questions for Data roles and way forward?,"Recently I have seen that in the second or third round companies are asking open ended one liners, how should we approach these? Apart from the Data model, they are also expecting that we make some low level code and APIs and then also explain them about why we chose one service over the other, explain about latency, throughput stuff etc.  
Examples:

1. Design a Rider Management Platform which will provide riders to different e-commerce/quick-commerce websites

2. Design DQ Framework.

3. Design whatsapp/instagram/twitter/Jira etc.

As someone who wants to grow more into this field, I mean like as I grow I want to be on the tech side only like Data Engineer - > Senior Data Engineer - > Lead/Staff DE -> Principal DE. How should we proceed? Because these questions are similar to the System design rounds for Software profiles. Also, I feel that next 5 years DE profile is going to be merged in to Software roles only, like we see in some companies with designation such as Data Software engineer or Software Engineer (Data).

Seeking guidance from Senior folks here.

1i4url5,What do you think of Talend?,"Qlik acquired Talend and has integrated it into their data studio for ingestion (currently limited to databases afaik).

Since our organization already uses Qlik, this was introduced to us last year. One of our team members spent a few weeks exploring it and concluded that it had its rough edges and was difficult to troubleshoot if something went wrong.

Now, it's being showed down our throats as it has been decided that Talend will be used for ingestions, because management believes UI-based tools equate to faster results. To counter this, I built a few ingestion pipelines for sources that Talend cannot handle (such as Rest APIs) using [dlt](https://github.com/dlt-hub/dlt) that have been working just fine since ~October of last year, but it seems that has fallen on deaf ears.

Has anyone here used the Qlik-integrated version of Talend? What’s your experience with it?",15,28,laegoiste,2025-01-19 09:24:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/dataengineering/comments/1i4url5/what_do_you_think_of_talend/,False,False,False,False

1i54dy3,Getting Foot in the Door as a Data Engineer,"I'm looking to make the switch to full time data engineering position. I find the field fascinating. I have working over last 7 years spending 1/2 my time as an analyst and 1/2 work non data related tasks. I want to make the switch to a permanent role. Pretty good at SQL, data visualization software's. Got a bit python experience as well. I'm close to south bay Silicon Valley and am open to working in office. Is that enough to get my foot in the door with the current scope of the market? Should I be contacting recruiters or is there a better method here?

1i4yvgd,Azure Data Factory Data Flow vs SQL script in Synapse ,"Hello guys!  
  
I would like to ask for you help in order to decide whether the current data pipeline usage is good or bad.  
  
In my company we use Azure stack. We gather the data from source systems (mostly Postgres and MariaDB) using Copy activity to acquire and store source data into Azure Data Lake Gen2 in parquet format.   
After that we use Data Flow activity to read the data from Azure Data Lake, do some transformations and then load the data into the Data Warehouse (Synapse Analytics Dedicated SQL Pool).   
What I experienced is that, by using Data Flow activity it takes some minutes (2-3 minutes) to accomplish a very basic data transformation task (such as loading fact data without having to calculate anything). Spark cluster has already been started, and TTL option is set, so it is not about instantiating a Spark cluster. The parquet files' size on the other hand are little (most of the time it does not reach 1 MB). The interesting fact is that when I monitor the Data Flow activity, the processing time is just about some seconds, but when I monitor the whole data pipeline it shows that the Data Flow activity ran for minutes, which is not effective and I think it should be run much faster.  
  
I tried out a new approach, which would be loading the raw data into Synapse Analytics (As Is), and then use SQL script activity to do the same transformation logic but this time the source data would be a staging table in Synapse to be able to execute SQL.  
It was much faster in terms of Data Pipeline execution time and also it became much cheaper approach, because i did not have to use Data Flow activity and Spark cluster.

I'm curious about your opinion about the data pipeline setup. Is there any better approach than using Data Flow activity to do this data transformation? Is it better to use Azure Databricks or Synapse notebook in pyspark for this job? Or what else could you recommend? I would like to learn from your experience. Any suggestion or opinion would be much appreciated!
